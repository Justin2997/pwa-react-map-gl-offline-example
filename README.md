# PWA Offline MAP Example
This is a simple example of how to use the [react-map-gl](https://github.com/visgl/react-map-gl) on a local install application offline.

## Start the application
Before starting the application be sure to have run `yarn install` to install all the dependencies. Also start the tileserver-gl server see [tileserver-gl/README.md](tileserver-gl/README.md) for more information.

Then you can start the application with `yarn start` and it should open a new tab in your browser.
